# Student Marks Management System (SQL Project)

This is a simple SQL-based project that manages the marks of 50 students across 5 subjects. The idea was to practice real-world database design and querying using only SQL â€” no frontend, no backend â€” just clean relational database work.

---

##  About the Project

I created this project to simulate how a school might store and analyze student marks. It includes:

- A `students` table with 50 names 
- A `subjects` table with 5 subjects
- A `marks` table that connects students and subjects (with 250 records)

The database is normalized and includes proper use of **primary** and **foreign keys**.

# How to Run

You can use any MySQL-compatible tool:

## Option 1: VS Code + MySQL
- Install the [SQLTools extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mtxr.sqltools)
- Connect to your local MySQL server
- Run the `.sql` files in order:
  1. `schema.sql`
  2. `data.sql`
  3. `marks.sql`
  4. `queries.sql` (run manually)

### Option 2: XAMPP + phpMyAdmin
- Start MySQL and Apache in XAMPP
- Go to [localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)
- Create a new database
- Import the `.sql` files in the same order

---

##  What's Inside the Queries

The `queries.sql` file includes:

- Average marks per student
- Top scorer per subject
- Students failing any subject (score < 35)
- Class-wise average
- Subject-wise highest marks

All written with `JOIN`s, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions like `AVG()` and `MAX()`.

##  Why I Made This

I wanted to build something simple but complete using **just SQL** â€” no web frameworks or programming languages.

This project helped me understand:

- How to design a normalized schema
- The importance of keys and constraints
- Writing clean, readable queries for reporting

---

##  Tech Used

- MySQL
- SQLTools (VS Code Extension)
- VS-Code

---

##  Use Cases

- Practice project for backend or database engineer roles
- Base schema for future full-stack result management system
